Just jotting down a few thoughts—today’s my first time studying at the university library.

Philip Greenspun feels like an old rascal—in the best possible way. Kind of like reading the diaries of Hu Shi or Ji Xianlin, where you can sense a life fully lived, infused into every word.

Phil is a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and his website hosts a bunch of textbooks he wrote himself—not just on computer science, but also photography, aerospace, even how to chase women. Haha. He’s been writing there since 1997, and I feel lucky to witness nearly 30 years of one man’s evolving mind.

I’m pretty sure he was a young man when he wrote SQL for Web Nerds, because somewhere in the intro he cracks a joke and—sincerely—links to a post he wrote on how to pursue women. I burst out laughing at the first line, which reads: “You should begin your personal homepage with a nude photo of yourself.” Of course, “nude” here probably means something more like an artistic shot, not just a flat, two-dimensional reveal of your body. After all, we live in a 3D world, and no one can truly judge a person by their front and back. Then again… mugshots do feature three angles, don’t they?

Back to artistic photos—this was clearly written ages ago, when people still met each other through personal websites. That feels like ancient history now, but the idea is still interesting. Many might not realize this, but tech guys are surprisingly good at writing dating manuals. I remember back in high school, there was a guy from Peking University who wrote three books on how to approach people and date. His reasoning? Engineers are good at following theory. If you turn dating into a system of rules, they can totally optimize it. Funny, right?

Phil's knack for writing textbooks is undeniable, but the little moments of humor are what make them unforgettable. Like when he said if he ever entered Hollywood, he’d need a trendier name—so he chose “Phil-baby.” That’s some dark humor right there. A nearly forty-year-old man calling himself that—proves that boys never really grow up.

Alright, that’s it for now. Don’t forget to look up and catch the sunset. It’s beautiful.

今天说点什么呢，简单记录一下第一次来学校图书馆自习，想到的东西。

Philp Greenspun像是一个老流氓，当然，这里用到这个词是褒义词。就像是胡适和季羡林的日记，我们能从文字，看到极富生活化的气质。

Phil是一位MIT的电气电子和计算机科学教授，他的网站有许多自己编著的课本，当然，这不仅局限于计算机领域，还有摄影，航天，怎么追女人等等。哈哈哈，他的网站从1997年开始记录，时过境迁，我很有幸能看到一个男人近30年的心理变化。

我相信他在写SQL for Web Nerds的时候还是个年轻人，因为在简介的中间段落，他就很风趣的开了一个玩笑，然后附上了，极具诚意的，附上了一篇他自己写的怎么追求女人的帖子。这个帖子的开头就给我笑喷了，他写：“你应该在个人主义的开头，附上一张自己的裸照”，当然这里的*更多意义应该是艺术照，而不是单纯的朴素主义的2D平面身材展示。毕竟我们是生活在三维世界的人类，没有人有能力通过看一个人的正面反面知道这个人好不好相处。其实，这句话我并没有百分百的把握，毕竟监狱里就需要囚犯的三面照片不是嘛。

继续说艺术照，鉴于这是一篇很久之前的帖子，看上去人们那时候交友还都是通过个人网站呢，对于我来说着实是很久之前了，但是这个理论应该是值得讨论的。毕竟我估计很多人不知道，理工男其实是最擅长编写恋爱教材的，我高中的时候就知道有一个北大的写了三本书教人怎么搭讪、怎么谈恋爱，而他的理由就是理工男是擅长依据理论做事的，如果将谈恋爱的理论总结成书，哈哈哈哈，很有意思的想法不是嘛。

Phil老头编教材的能力当然不容小觑，但是其中有意思的片段总是让人捧腹大笑，例如他说，如果有一天他进军好莱坞了，那就不得不像一个更加时尚的名字，所以他给自己的绰号就是”Phil-baby”，这就有点黑色幽默了，因为一个快四十岁的老头了，这么幽默，真的证明男人至死都是少年。

就到这里吧，记得抬头看看窗外的晚霞。很漂亮。

**I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in the U.S. I'm also open to research student opportunities in human-centered AI or systems for generative models. If you are hiring or collaborating, feel free to reach out!**

I’m currently a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), expecting to graduate in May 2026.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, recommendation systems, and generative models. Recently, I’ve been exploring how to improve user experience and evaluation pipelines for diffusion-based image generation and 3D latent representation models.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate study in Computer Science and participated in several cross-disciplinary projects that combined machine learning with real-world user needs. I'm also passionate about building user-facing systems that bridge research and practice.

In side projects, I’ve worked with open APIs (like arXiv, Firebase, Semantic Scholar) and experimented with integrating LLMs into mobile and web apps. My contributions span from front-end design to backend system architecture.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, building LEGO models, and photographing flash-lit scenes. I’m also a board game fan and occasionally blog about things I enjoy.

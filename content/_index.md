I'm Zachary(Ziyue) Zhuang, a CS Master's student at UIUC, graduating in May 2026. My work focuses on human-centered AI, generative models, and recommendation systems. I'm currently exploring evaluation and interaction design for diffusion and Fractal generative systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy building user-facing tools with LLMs and APIs like arXiv and Firebase. I also play tennis, cook, build LEGO sets, and occasionally write blogs on belles-lettres and board games.

**I'm currently seeking full-time roles or visiting research opportunities in related fields—feel free to reach out!**
